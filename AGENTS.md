## Common Varinomics Rules

This repository follows the shared Varinomics standards. Do not duplicate,
reinterpret, or weaken those rules locally.

Before modifying code, read the coding guideline and LLM addendum:

- `varinomics_coding_style_guideline.md`
- `varinomics_coding_style_llm_addendum.md`

Before producing a code review, read:

- `varinomics_review_scope.md`

Before work that will span more than one commit, migration, refactor, or
multi-step feature, read:

- `varinomics_change_governance.md`

If the addendum conflicts with the guideline, the addendum wins. If you are
unsure which standard applies, read all four before proceeding.

## Review and Plan Artifacts

Default rule: do not stage or commit review reports, review plans,
implementation plans, analysis notes, working notes, investigation reports,
phase plans, or other transient documentation unless the user explicitly
requests a repo-tracked artifact.

These files are scratch work. Keep them outside the repository or delete them
when done; do not add them to `.gitignore` as a workaround.

## Local Windows Toolchain

The user-wide policy at `C:\Users\imak\.codex-vnm\AGENTS.md` is the single
source of truth for native Windows build queueing, toolchain selection,
FASTBuild configuration, and distributed-build flags. If that file is not
available, the minimum requirements are Visual Studio 2026 with MSVC v145 and a
fresh out-of-source FASTBuild tree. Start one `cmd.exe` shell, initialize it with
`vcvarsall.bat x64 -vcvars_ver=14.51`, and keep the initial configure, every
explicit or automatic regeneration, and every build inside that same initialized
shell. Each compiler- or linker-capable step still runs through `queued-build`:
configure and explicitly regenerate with
`queued-build --slots 1 -- <cmake> ... -G FASTBuild`, and build with
`queued-build --slots 2 -- <cmake> --build <build-dir> -- -dist -nolocalrace -monitor`.
Do not supply another parallel-width flag or silently fall back to Visual Studio
2022.

The Windows debuggers are installed at:
`C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64`

If a native build cannot find standard headers such as `stddef.h` or
`optional`, verify the VS2026 developer environment and the generated
FASTBuild `LocalEnv` before changing source code.

## Codex Claude Review Helper

Codex agents may invoke Claude review-only sessions through
`C:\plms\invoking_claude_from_codex` when a task calls for Claude review.
This instruction is for Codex only: Claude must not use this helper to invoke
Claude.
